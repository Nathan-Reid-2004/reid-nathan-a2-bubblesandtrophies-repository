Repository containing all work &amp; documents related to Assignment 2 for GAME-10003-02. Bubbles is a basic 2D interactive terminal game where the objective is to meet 1 of 3 win conditions. If a condition is not met within 30 seconds, the player is met with a game over screen. If the player sucessfully meets a win condition, all the bubbles will be popped, and a 'win' screen will appear. The game must be reset upon winning or losing the game. 

Win Condition #1: The FPS of the game can be controlled by using the mouse buttons. Holding left click makes the FPS increase, whereas holding right click does the inverse. The player must try to get in the range of 30 to 40 FPS. Once they think they have a correct FPS count, they can hold down the middle mouse button, which will pop all the bubbles if the FPS is in the correct range. 

Win Condition #2: This method of winning is a bit simpler. The player must get their mouse cursor to hit the exact coordinates of (200, 200)- directly in the middle of the screen. If the cursor crosses these coordinates, the player wins.

Win Condition #3: The final way to win the game is to essentially replicate the pattern of small squares seen in the 'bomb' in the middle of the playspace. The player must hold down the following keyboard keys all at once in order to win: 'B' 'H' 'U' '8' 'T' 'M'
